This repository contains the code and documentation for the Synchronized Security System (SSS). The system integrates various security components like cameras, motion detectors, smoke detectors, and fingerprint sensors to create a robust and synchronized security solution. The system is controlled through an Android application, leveraging machine learning for face recognition and sensor data processing.

Features:

--> Electronic Security Devices: Includes motion detectors, door and window security modules, and smoke detectors.

--> Camera Integration: Utilizes both indoor and outdoor cameras with real-time face recognition.

--> Server-Client Interface: Synchronizes sensor data and visual input using a central hub (Raspberry Pi 4) and a cloud database (AWS RDS).

--> Android Application: Developed using Microsoft PowerApps for seamless access and control of the security system.

--> Machine Learning: Real-time face recognition powered by OpenCV, using pre-trained models for reliable detection.
